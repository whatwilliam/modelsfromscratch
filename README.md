# modelsfromscratch
I'm showing how to create past models like VGG, ResNet, DenseNet, Inception, etc. from scratch to help others learning about deep learning through Tensorflow and Tensorflow datasets.

It's best if you follow along with the original paper for the model when recreating the model while looking at my models -

ResNet: https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385
