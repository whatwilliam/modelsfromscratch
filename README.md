# modelsfromscratch
I'm showing how to create past models like VGG, ResNet, DenseNet, Inception, etc. from scratch to help others learning about deep learning through Tensorflow and Tensorflow datasets.

It's best if you follow along with the original papers for the models - 
VGG: https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556
ResNet: https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385
Inception: https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.4842
DenseNet: https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06993
Inception-v4: https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07261
ResNeXt: https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05431
